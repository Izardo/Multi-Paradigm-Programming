# Multi-Paradigm-Programming
Project for Multi Paradigm Programming module as part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics, GMIT (2021).

# Project objective

To build a shop program in three different programming paradigms with various functionalities. Each program has the same functionalities and are implemented in such a way that the user experience is identical. 

To view the comprehensive project brief and functionalities you can do so [here]((https://learnonline.gmit.ie/pluginfile.php/523830/mod_resource/content/0/Assignment%201%20-%20Shop.pdf).

# Contents of repository

1. There are three programs contained within this repository:
    - a C program in procedural style 
    - a python program in procedural style and
    - an object oriented style python program.

2. Five CSV files each with customer's name, budget and shopping list.

# How to run on your machine

1. Install Python. If you have not done so already, Real Python gives a comprehensive [guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on how to install it on your machine. 
2. Install C. A [guide](https://www.w3schools.in/c-tutorial/install/) by W3 Schools with instructions on how to install.
3. Open whatever version of command line interface you have on your machine. That would be terminal on Mac/Linux and cmd on windows.
4. Navigate to the folder where your shop programs are saved.
5. To run the program 
    - For Python type: python and the name of your file. <i>Example: python shop_oop.py</i>
    - For C you must first compile the program by typing gcc and the name of your program. Example: gcc shop.c and then to run it type: ./ and the name of the program. <i>Example: ./a.out</i> Help on how to run a C program can be found [here](https://www.edureka.co/blog/how-to-compile-c-program-in-command-prompt/).
